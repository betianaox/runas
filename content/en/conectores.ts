// Templates that build ONE combined sentence from the three runes, in the
// order they came out (no fixed past/present/future roles). Generic across
// topics: the specific meaning already lives in the fragments.

//               {frag1} {frag2} {frag3} = fragments from content/en/fragmentos/<tema>.ts
//
// Fragments are noun phrases, so the verbs (brings/adds/points to) live here.
